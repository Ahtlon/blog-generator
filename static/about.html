        </p>
        <p>My name is Mario Zupan, I'm a Software Developer from Graz, Austria.</p>
        <p>After finishing my MSc in Software Engineering &amp; Economics at <a href="https://www.tugraz.at/" target="_blank">TU Graz</a> I worked as a Full-Stack Web Developer for five years doing mostly Java and JavaScript with a focus on Clean Code and Software Craftsmanship.</p>
        <p>In September 2016, I decided to quit my job and work as a freelancing consultant and trainer as well as to dedicate about half of my time to working in Open Source.</p>
        <p>In the past, I organized the JavaScript User Group in Graz and I frequently visit and speak at other local meetups as well.</p>
        <p>Currently I enjoy writing Go code and having the freedom to choose what to work on.</p>
        <p>I'm always looking for interesting projects using Go or JavaScript - if you're looking for an experienced and motivated developer, feel free to contact me! :)</p>
